# Task Overview
Let's implement a text buffer data structure, that could be utilized by the text editors we use everyday, with the following methods:

`__str__` - Allows us to call print() on our buffer to print out all of its contents
`append` - Adds a character to the back of the text buffer
`prepend` - Adds a character to the front of the text buffer
`delete_front` - Removes a character from the front of the text buffer
`delete_back` - Removes a character from the back of the text buffer
`join` - Concatenates another text buffer onto the end of this buffer

These methods should all be as efficient as possible (we can get most of them down to O(1) time). To achieve this, what data structure(s) would make good candidates for backing our text buffer implementation? An array? A LinkedList? A DoublyLinkedList?
