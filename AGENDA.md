## Rationale behind the module
The "best" data structure for the specific project or application you are working on will depend on its unique specification. During this sprint, we will be diving into how common operations (insertion, deletion, access, search, etc) work with different data structures. This will help us to understand when you might chose one data structure over another for different projects.

## Takeaways for the module
This is what you should get out of this module.

- General understanding of how we can utilize data structures such as an array, stack, queue, linked list, tree, and heap in Python
- Details about how various operations (insertion, deletion, access, search, etc) are implemented for each data structure
- Runtime of the aforementioned operations on various data structures
